# American 10-pin Bowling

## Problem, step one:
See [the link](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/) for a problem description.  Given an input string representing a valid sequence of bowled frames, compute the score.  Add some unit tests with the given test cases, and any others you may wish to add.

## Problem, step two:
Validate the input.  Identify sequences of input that do not constitute valid games.  Specifically, the number of knocked-down (not bonus) pins in each frame must not exceed 10.  Additionally, there must be exactly 10 frames total (allowing necessary bonus throws).  Expand your test cases to cover this.

## Problem, bonus:
Allow partial games.  Score sequences of input that do not yet constitute a full game but are otherwise valid partial games.  Produce the score for the last fully-scored frame (and identify which frame this is, for partial games).  Expand your test cases to cover this.
